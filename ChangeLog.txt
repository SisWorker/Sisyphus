Boting 7/13:

ver 0.04 

	1. added slope tag, using layer to differentiate ground


	2.rock heavier:

		player move at lower speed when pushing rock

		rock now has a speed limit, and the limit is lowered when being pushed by player

		
	3.player sprite now can flip according to moving direction.

	4.player can jump on rock to slow and stop rock's movement, can freeze rock on a slope.

	problem: 

	5.player's speed on slope needs to eb normalized, it is moving faster than intended on slope.

	
	6.tried to used raycast to dected upward slope and downward slope, did not work out very well.
	also the downward movement is not smooth when a downward force is added.

	solved the raycast and move downward problem
	
	problem:
	
	1. rock's contact check circle is not bigger than rock collider itself, and is not set as a trigger. the rock is also not tagged as "rockContact"
		therefore animation not triggered when player contact rock

	
	
ver 0.06
	1. rock contact problem solved
	
	2. adjusted player collider positions so player can seem like walking on the ground
	
	3. added a circle collider to player so rock will not overlap with player sprite when on steep slope
	
	4. rock no longer freeze rotation
	
	5. rock gravity scale changed to 3, so it will no longer bounce off player into the air when sliding down hill and hit player. looks heavier too.
	
	6.
