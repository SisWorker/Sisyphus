Boting 7/13:

ver 0.04 

	1. added slope tag, using layer to differentiate ground


	2.rock heavier:

		player move at lower speed when pushing rock

		rock now has a speed limit, and the limit is lowered when being pushed by player

		
	3.player sprite now can flip according to moving direction.

	4.player can jump on rock to slow and stop rock's movement, can freeze rock on a slope.

	problem: 

	5.player's speed on slope needs to eb normalized, it is moving faster than intended on slope.

	
	6.tried to used raycast to dected upward slope and downward slope, did not work out very well.
	also the downward movement is not smooth when a downward force is added.

ver 0.05
	solved the raycast and move downward problem

ver 0.06--7/15

	1. sloved the bug that rock tends to float up when being pushed upward by limiting its y speed
	2. sloved the hiden bug caused by vector that player acctually move faster when moving on slope
	3. changed pushing speed to make the game more smooth
	4. added a polygon collider to player that player now looks more like walking on ground

ver 0.07 --7/16
	1. added wheel and bridge. bridge belongs to ground layer and spins to a centain degree 
	while player interact with wheel.
	2. bridge's tag change to slope when forms a slope.
	2. added input botton "interact", the key is E.
	3. canceled player's ability to jump while pushing rock.
	4. saved sevral important gameObjects as prefabs.

ver 0.08 --7/24
	1. changed the bridge control that not it use colliderContact to stop at certain points;
	2. updated the wall prefab that caused play to stick on wall;
	3. now uses raycast to do groundCheck for jumping, fixed the potential problem of flying

ver 0.09-- 7/29
	1. used 2d platform effctor to slopes and flats
	2. added rigidbody to bridge to make them more stable
	3. imporved player onground detection

ver 0.10 --7/30
	1. used raycast to detect player-rock contact, now player only push rock when is onground and moving toward
	rock's direction
	2. added a rock layer
	3. updated several prefabs for minor improvements
	4. updated the animator and the boolean control, player's pushing animation now display properly when going complicated terrains
	5. reorganized the playercontrol scipt for stability and readability.
	6. improved the bridge to make it automatically behave as wall, slope or ground depending on its angle.

ver 0.12--8/6
	1. now player can go down through the platform by pressing down
	2. now rock will roll back after a while not touched by player

ver 0.13--8/10
	1. completed the bridge throw mechanism
	2. updated prefabs and added new scripts: sky, rockwall, ground, and rock.

ver 0.14--8/14
	1. imporved going down and jump mechanism
	2. holding space will allow player to jump higher
	3. now sky and cloud has layers and will move resonds ton player's movement differently.

ver 0.15--8/19
	1. added a raw version of pole
	2. imrpoved the smoothness of sky movement
