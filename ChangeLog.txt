Boting 7/13:

ver 0.04 

	1. added slope tag, using layer to differentiate ground


	2.rock heavier:

		player move at lower speed when pushing rock

		rock now has a speed limit, and the limit is lowered when being pushed by player

		
	3.player sprite now can flip according to moving direction.

	4.player can jump on rock to slow and stop rock's movement, can freeze rock on a slope.

	problem: 

	5.player's speed on slope needs to eb normalized, it is moving faster than intended on slope.

	
	6.tried to used raycast to dected upward slope and downward slope, did not work out very well.
	also the downward movement is not smooth when a downward force is added.

ver 0.05
	solved the raycast and move downward problem

ver 0.06
	1. sloved the bug that rock tends to float up when being pushed upward by limiting its y speed
	2. sloved the hiden bug caused by vector that player acctually move faster when moving on slope
	3. changed pushing speed to make the game more smooth
	4. added a polygon collider to player that player now looks more like walking on ground
